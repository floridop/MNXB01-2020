#
# Description: this script manuipulates specific SMHI dataset and 
#              performs some cleaning actions on it, namely:
#              - if the file is on a http site, downloads it, otherwise
#                takes the file from the specified path;
#              - Cleanses up unwanted information in the data file and
#                 extracts just the raw temperature data in
#                 - rawdata_<filename>
#              - prepares the file to be read by standard C++ 
#                CSV libraries
#
# Examples:
#        ./smhicleaner.sh 'https://github.com/floridop/MNXB01-2020/raw/master/floridopag/tutorial3/homework3/data/smhi-opendata_1_52240_20200905_163726.csv'
#        ./smhicleaner.sh /nfs/shared/pp/MNXB01/tutorial3/homework3/data/smhi-opendata_1_52240_20200905_163726.csv
#
# NOTE: the paths above are examples. I will put the file in different 
# paths when correcting. 
# So you should NOT assume the file is exactly in any of the above paths.
# The code must be able to process any possible http(s):// or file path.

# - download with wget if yes
# - copy with cp if not
# for hints about the IP condition, see

# hints:
# - use the grep option -n  and cut to take just the number.
# - use the cut command to select field 1 using ':' as separator
# - Use the pipe | to pass the output of grep to cut
# Examples about the above can be found in Tutorial 3 slide 85

# redirect the standard output.
# hints: how to exclude n lines with tail : http://heyrod.com/snippets/skip-n-lines.html

# consider only the relevant columns (1,2,3,4,5) using cut
# this will clean up the lines at the beginning of the data 
# that are not consistent with the format, so that we can use the data 
# these lines contain without discarding them.

# Change semicolons to singe spaces using sed and 
# write out the result to a file called rawdata_${DATAFILE}
# hint: read about sed at the links in Tutorial 3 slide 85,
# and here: https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-sed-to-find-and-replace-string-in-files/

# To get the highest grade (5), you need to complete
# all the above exercises plus this one. 
# Using a for, scan all the .csv files in the folder and write out a
# report of their size.
# cycle the files with a variable csvfile
# Save the size of each file in variable SIZE using the "stat" command
# see: https://www.howtogeek.com/451022/how-to-use-the-stat-command-on-linux/
